<p>This application shows how to use hammer.js, swipeout.js with Backbone.</p>

<p>hammer.js provides AMD version of it when used along with require.js. However swipeout.js is non AMD and tries to use global variable version of hammer.js. Hence I've modified swipeout.js to make it AMD compatible. Use the same file.</p>
